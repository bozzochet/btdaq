There are 3 directories:

- DAQ with the Data Acquisition software (Usable via EPP or PCI. Compatible with TDR, JINF and  JINJ DSP programs as in July 2009 and usable with JLV1, NI-USB or manual trigger. The data can be written in AMS Block format or in binary standard one. Calibration can be written in AMS Block format or text one visible with SUMMARY on a pdf)

- Decode with Decoding software for converting binary files (it works only with this type of data and with text calibration files) to Root ones

- Scan with Analisis software for creating Hisotgrams from Root files (IT IS MADE BY WJB AND IS NOT A STABLE VERSION. CAN BE USED ONLY AS TEMPLAE)

Enjoy!
