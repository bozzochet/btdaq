TRD ToDo list (Incomplete)


AMSTRDIdSoft:

introduce individual ped,sigma,gain and tgeir db records via timeid

write some daqformat (2 crates) and conversion daq<->raw

By VC


AMSTRDRawHit: more realistic noise

By VC

AMSTRDCluster:

AMSTRDSegment:

faster algorithm

By GL

AMSTRDTrack:

By GL
faster algorithm

add trd related quantities (number of energetic clusters or 
some likelyhood amalysis)

By KS

AMSParticle: 

in the absence of track add trd to tof to form one strline track
Refine tracker/trd matching & introduce tof/trd one.

By VC

get Gamma Threshold from trd (1/sqrt(1-beta^2)

By KS

Overall : 

Refine ntuple quantities and add new ones if necessary

By Everybody
