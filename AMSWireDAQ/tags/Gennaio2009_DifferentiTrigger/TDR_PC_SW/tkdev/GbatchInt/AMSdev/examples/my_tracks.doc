/*! \example my_tracks.doc
 *  The program below (my_tracks.C) illustrates how to define
 *  and fit your own tracks directly on the ROOT file, with 
 *  your own selected hits and optionally without magnetic field
 * (straight line fit). No multiple scattering is included for 
 * the moment.
 *    - To run it: root -b -q my_tracks.C
 *
 *  \include my_tracks.C
