Configuration File:
___________________________

In this directory you can find all the stuff (except for TESTjmdc of which there's a simbolic link)
needed for create and load configuration files for JINF-Ts:

- ConfigFile:            this is the program to create binary config files for JINF-Ts starting from a "human readable" parameters file
                         (as example JINFParamFile_X.txt, with X is the crate number in [0-8])
			 and to create the script (LoadConfs_X.sh, with X is the crate number in [0-8])	usefull to uplaod the binary files

- LoadConfs_X.sh:        the script that load the correct configuration file in JINF-T number X

- CreateAndLoadConfs.sh:          the script that load the correct configuration file in each JINF-T

- JINFParamFile_X.txt:   can be used as a template for the "human readable" parameter file for JINF-T X


8 different configuration files are created for the 8 crates/JINFs (for now all equals except for crate/JINF 4 [PowerGroup3 with Bias 60V]).
The file of parameters ("human readable file") can be filled using the JINF documentation by Kounine or the JINF-T one by Philipp Azzarello.


Procedure:

The procedure has to be (to change and load the config file BBBB, erasing the old conf file AAAA, only for the JINF-T X using JINJ NN and JINJ MM to talk with JINF-T A and JINF-T B):

   1. Create a parameter file or edit the template (JINFParamFile_X.txt)
   2. ./ConfigFile JINFParamFile_X.txt X NN MM
   3. ./LoadConfs_X.sh 

The procedure has to be (to change and load the config file BBBB, erasing the old conf file AAAA, on all JINF-Ts using JINJ NN and JINJ MM to talk with JINF-T's A and JINF-T's B): 
   1. Edit the template parameter files (JINFParamFile_X.txt's) (they will be called automatically called by the script below)
   2. ./LoadConfs.sh NN MM AAAA BBBB
