**  TBS  **
***********

The TBS is composed of four linear regulators, each producing either 80 or 60 V. 
The TBS also produces the guard ring voltages for S- and K- sides. 
The power distribution is split into two halves:

  * half 0, corresponding to TDR lines 0 to 5;
  * half 1, which is related to TDR lines 6 to 11.

12 circuits are used to produce each S-guard ring voltage. Unless the +/-6 V supply is
switched off (from S9055), there is no way to switch off the S-guard ring voltage.

The K-guard ring voltage is distributed by each linear regulator, while the 
local ground K is produced by two circuits, one for each half.

Each half is supplied by two regulators, called ``Hot'' and ``Cold''. 
The way those regulators interact is important:

  * By design, Hot and Cold cannot be ``on'' at the same time 
    (but there are protection diodes in case of failure).
  * By default HOT is ``on''.
  * If Hot stops supplying high voltage (whatever the reason is), Cold will do.
  * To stop the supply of high voltage, one needs to explicitly send 
    an ``off'' signal to both regulators.
  * It is possible to set a different voltage level for Hot and Cold. 
    It is thus important to apply the same settings to both regulators.

Following table summarizes these rules:
 ----------------------------------
| Hot off  |  Cold off  | GRINGK   |
 ----------------------------------
|    0     |     0      | From Hot |
|    0     |     1      | From Hot |
|    1     |     0      | From Cold|
|    1     |     1      | 0        |
 ----------------------------------

The linear regulators are indexed from 0 to 3, with following correspondence:

 ----------------
| Index |  LR    |
 ----------------
|   0   | Hot 0  |
|   1   | Hot 1  |
|   2   | Cold 0 |
|   3   | Cold 1 |
