/*! \example select_entries.doc
 *  The program below (select_entries.C) illustrates how to write 
 *  a subsample of selected events into a new AMS Root file. 
 *    - To run it: root -b -q select_entries.C
 *
 *  The example also illustrates how to read/write just few
 *  branches, thus saving some time on input and some disk 
 *  space on output.
 *
 *  If you prefer to read/write all branches, just comment
 *  the pieces of code between "BEGIN of block" and 
 *  "END of block".
 *
 *  \include select_entries.C
