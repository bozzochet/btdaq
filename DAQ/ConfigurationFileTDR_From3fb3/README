Configuration File:
___________________________

In this directory you can find all the stuff (except for TESTjmdc of 
which there's a simbolic link) needed for create and load 
configuration files for TDRs:


- ConfigFile:   	       this is the program to create binary config files for TDRs
  			       starting from a "human readable" parameters file (as example TDRParamFile.txt)
			       and to create the script (LoadConfs.sh) usefull to uplaod the binary files  

- LoadConfs.sh:		       the script that load the correct configuration file in each TDR

- TDRParamFile.txt:	       can be used as a template for the "human readable" parameter file for TDR


The file of parameters ("human readable file") can be filled using the TDR documentation by Philipp Azzarello
and taking into account that for "compliantness" a parameter indicated as "N" here has to written as "0 0 N"
(where the first two numbers are the Group and the SubGroup, here 0).

- The script for loading the configuration file has to be called using 1 parameter
(the JMDC port to be used, i.e.
to use JINF-T-B [JMDC ports: 0,3]
to use JINF-T-A [JMDC ports: 1,2])

Procedure:

The procedure has to be:

   1.  Create a parameter file or edit the template (* TDRParamFile.txt)
   2. ./ConfigFile * TDRParamFile.txt]] <S1HighThresh> <S1LowThresh> <S2HighThresh> <S2LowThresh> <KHighThresh> <KLowThresh> <OldConfFileName> <NewConfFileName>
      the 6 thresholds for external planes ( up to now, it means layer 1 & 8, in the future has to be probably 1 & 8 & 9) HAS TO BE PASSED EXPLICITELY (Thresholds have to be passed in 'standard' way (1, 2, 3.5, ...))
      ConfFileName is the name of the configuration files that will be produced
      OldConfFileName is the name of the "old" configuration file to be erased in order to write the new one 
   3. ./LoadConfs.sh #port
