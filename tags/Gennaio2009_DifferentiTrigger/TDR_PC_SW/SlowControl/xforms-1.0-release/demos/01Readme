Here are a few demos demonstrating the usage and appearance of
object classes in the XForms Library. Note that these programs
also serve as testing/QA programs, so if you have a problem with
a particular object, see if the same object works in the
demo program.

Simply type demo to start the demo/test suite. 

If shared library is provided, you will have to either move
the shared library to the standard directory or define
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include
the directory where the shared libary resides.

Almost all demos are borderless or transient, thus may "stick"
to the screen (some *vwm's can't switch them "off"). For real programs, this 
is a BAD idea. 

OpenGL/Mesa demos are by default not generated. If you have the necessary
libaries (OpenGL or Mesa2.0) and are using the static library, type make 
gl glwin to generate the demos. If you're using Mesa version other than
2.0, you probably should compile ../FORMS/gl.c and replace the
one in the library.

If you're running the demo on a B&W Xterminal, some of the
"colors" might be off.
