------------------------------------------

  o. Fixed condition in forms.c preventing use of cursor keys.
  o. Fumigated with -Wall, eliminating all complaints in xforms
     sources.

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC2	June 1, 2002
  o. Picked up some missing prototypes in `flimage.h'.
  o. Deleted fl_snprintf() with snprintf() and changed all references
     thereto.  Added a new library for those lacking the latter
     function, filched from the SpamAssassin distributon, of all things.
     Had to hack it a bit to get it to work.  Others, on other systems,
     may have to as well.

------------------------------------------
V1.0RC1	May 30, 2002
  o. Very minor API changes.  `FL_ERROR_FUNC' has been typedef'd for
     fl_set_error_handler() function.  `FL_VAL_FILTER' has also been
     typedef'd for use by fl_set_{counter,slider}_filter().  Neither
     of these changes should affect much of anything.
  o. The flimage functions are in their own library now: libflimage.
     They should be usable standalone, but I have not had an
     opportunity to test them.
  o. The OpenGL functions are in their own library now: libformsGL
     fl_add_glcanvas() and its ilk live there.  Application build scripts/
     Makefiles should include -lformsGL.
  o. The Xpm library is no longer built or distributed with XForms.
  o. The majority of the function prototypes in `forms.h' have been
     expanded to include variable names.
  o. various bug fixes.
