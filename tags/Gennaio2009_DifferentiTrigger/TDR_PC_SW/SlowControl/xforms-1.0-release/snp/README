If you're reading this, I assume that you don't have snprintf().  The
code in this directory attempts to provide that function.

I've replaced the `Makefile' with an `Imakefile', as is my wont.  Only
snprintf() and strtod() are built.  It has been slightly hacked to
make it work under SunOS 4.1.4.  It may not work elsewhere.  

The text following came from the SpamAssassin distribution, whence
this code was filched.  I'm not sure how helpful it might be but here
it is.

  Okay, details. It is based on BSD44-lite's vfprintf() call. I didn't
  replace the vfprintf()/fprintf()/etc.

  It needs internal routines from the 4.4 strtod (included).
  And I threw strtoul in as well. 
  (You already include that in your compat/lib). 
  The 4.4 syslog(3) client code is there, using the snprintf().
  The problem is that it supports %q. This requires long long support,
  so this has to compiled with gcc. You then need libgcc.a to link. I
  considered removing the long long support, but since libgcc.a is
  explicitely non-encumbered, I didn't worry about it.

  I've linked this in with sendmail 8.6.12. I sent it to Eric Allman, but I
don't know if he included it in 8.7.
  Do what you like with this code, but leave my name somewhere.

  The code is at ftp://ftp.milkyway.com/pub/mcr/snp.tar.gz
