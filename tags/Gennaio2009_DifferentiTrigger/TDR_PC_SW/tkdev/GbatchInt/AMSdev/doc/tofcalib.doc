     The following "on-data"-calibration procedures are developed upto now:
 
1) STRR-calibration:
     stretcher_ratio/offset calculation for every of 112 channels
     using the parametrization Tout=p1+p2*Tin, p1 - offset, p2 - stretcher
     ratio;
     
2) AVSD-calibration:
     Calculation of Dynode/Anode-correlation parameters; used parametrization
     is dTdyn=p1+p2*dTan, where dTdyn and dTan are Dynode and Anode
     "time_over_threshold", p1 - offset due to lower gain of dynode,
     p2 - correlation factor (slope);

3) TDIF-calibration:
     calculate "0" time-difference and effective light velocity for
     each of 56 TOF-counters ("0" means two side time difference for
     particles with "0" impact point (center))
     
4) TZSL-calibration:
     To calculate T0's for each of 56 counters and common (for 56 counters) 
     slope in T=(t1+t2)/2 vs (1/Qa1+1/Qa2) dependence (slewing correction);
     This procedure needs at least momentum measurement from tracker;
     In principal, individual slewing corrections may be used by reco-program,
     in this case calibration procedure for common slope(should be =1) may
     gives info about common drift of indiv. slewing corrections; 
     
5) AMPL-calibration:
     To calculate relative (wrt ref.bar in each counter size-group) gains
     (each side), position correction (for each ref.bar) and abs. normali-
     zation (mip->pC) (for each ref.bar);
     This procedure needs at least momentum measurement from tracker and
     all previous TOF calibration already done.
     
       The items 3. may be repeated (after item 4. was done) if "slewing 
  correction" option was used during the run.
       Any recalibration for any item should be followed by recalibration of
  all items below (with some small exeptions which should be selected very
  carefully).
       The items 1-2 are made during one run (when corresponding flag was
  selected).
       The outputs from different calibration items are ASCII files filled with
  corresponding parameters. The data from these files (and log-files) should be 
  carefully checked on "reasonability" , especially when some hardware modifications
  was done. The "by hands" corrections may be applied (for example if program put
  bad status for some channel (e.g in STRR-calibration due to bad chi2) and you 
  want force this channel to be used in later reconstruction).
  
       These output calibration files are:
       
    a) srcalibNNmc.dat/srcalibMMrl.dat for MC/REAL-data, where NN/MM are the
       version numbers. This srscalib... file combine info from STRR-calibration
       and status of each channel (alive/dead(noisy)) - see explanation inside
       the file. Stretcher parameters may be also taken from Bolognia test measu-
       rements.
       
    b) incalibNNmc.dat/incalibMMrl.dat for MC/REAL-data. These files contain
       anode-integrator parameters (average "over_all_channels" values for MC)
       and dynode-integrator parameters (....................................).
       The anode parameters are taken FROM BOLOGNIA GROUP (test-setup measurements),
       the dynode parameters may be taken from AVSD-calibration or again from
       BOLOGNIA GROUP.
       
    c) tdcalibNNmc.dat/tdcalibMMrl.dat files contain individual light speeds and "0" 
       time-differences (output from TDIF-calibration). This file is output from
       TDIF-calibration.
    d) tzcalibNNmc.dat/tzcalibMMrl.dat files contain slewing correction (common 
       for all channels slope) and T0's for each bar. This file is output from 
       TZSL-calibration.
       
    e) ancalibNNmc.dat/ancalibMMrl.dat files contain now individual anode_to_dinode
       ratios (these are used only by MC because for REAL events the Contin's
       parametrization is used currently for dinodes (it includes already an_to_dyn  
       ratio). These files contain also relative (to ref.bar) channel gains, impact
       point corrections (for ref. bars) and abs.calibration factors (for ref.bars).
       These 3 sets of parameters are taken from AMPL-calibration output.
      
       The reconstruction program don't use this files directly. It use the copies
    of these files: srscalibNNrl.dat, tdvcalib..., tzscalib..., anacalib... The file
    incalibNNmc.dat/incalibMMrl.dat is used directly because it is not now the
    output of any calibration procedure( It is created by hands on the basis of
    integrator parameters supplied by Bolognia group). This file correcponds to
    current configuration of SFET card numbers.
       These copies(+geomconfLL.dat) should be kept in /Offline/AMSDataDir/v2.15  
    (AMSDATADIR.amsdatadir default, used by Reco-program as storage for calibration data)                  
           
       The version numbers NN/MM for each kind of final calibration files to be read
    are defined inside of tofverslistKK.dat file which is read first at the 
    beginning of program initialization phase. The version number KK of this file
    is defined by datacard TOFCA 28 and is in the range 01-99 (def.value=1).
    
       There are also geometry data files geomconf01.dat and geomconf02.dat. One
    of these file is read by program with version number declared on the second
    line of tofverslistKK.dat file.(For now 01 corresponds to earth configuration,
    02 - Shuttle.).
                               ***********************
                               
       When the situation with AMS hardware is stable one can use semiautomatic
    calibration procedure ( to create new calibr. update with number NN):
    
    1) cd tofcadir (this is some existing directory next to top(user) one)
    
    2) cp /Offline/AMSDataDir/v2.15/incalibMMrl.dat incalibNNrl.dat. Modify
       incalibNNrl.dat file if needed (if any SFET cards was chenged).
       (MM is latest existing version).
       
    3) cp /Offline/AMSDataDir/v2.15/tofverslistMM.dat tofverslistNN.dat
       Modify it in accordance with new version number NN.
       
    4) Run in nice mode the following script
       globtofcal_nt FN NN MM 1>fn.log 2>fn.log &
       ( here "globtofcal_nt" is script to use use for calibration without tracker.
         To use the tracker - run "globtofcal" script. In this script only TZSL and
         AMPL steps use tracker info.).
        The FN is the file(FN1,FN2,... if >1) name to use for calibration; NN,MM always
         2-digits (like 01,05.10,26,...)
        
    5) After the job is finished (few hours for no_tracker version) check the log file
       (it will contain the outputs from all calibration steps).
       
    6) Modify script file "updatedb" with correct validity time.
       Run it in nice mode:
         updatedb FN NN 1>test.log 2>test.log & 
       (here FN - file name of the FIRST file used for calibration).
       It will copy necessary files to /Offline/AMSDataDir/v2.15 directory;
       create 3 global TOF-TDV files Tofbarcal1.1.FN, Tofmsscans.1.FN, 
       Tofvpar.1.FN; and run short test job (using new set of calibr.output files 
       from /Offline/AMSDataDir/v2.15 directory). If test.log OK :
       
    *7) Create links for all files you will need to use with this calibration data:
    
       cd /Offline/AMSDataDir/v2.15
       toflink FN other_fn
       
       This step 7) is only needed if 3 TOF-TDV files was not put into
       objectivity DB by A.Klimentov.   
       
    *) not needed in new Vitali's (non-objectivity !!!) DB
