In order to run RQMD you need to do
(under UNIX)

chmod +x  create_rqmd
create_rqmd

(or the sequence of steps listed in file `create_rqmd').
You might need to change the makefile slightly. For instance,
the program requires a link to the CERN library. You must provide
the proper location of this  library  on your computer.
