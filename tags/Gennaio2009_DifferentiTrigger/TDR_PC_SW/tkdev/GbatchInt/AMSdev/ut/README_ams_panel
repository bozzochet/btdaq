# AMS Software Panel, coded using Tcl/Tk,     J. Alcaraz 09-Dec-1003
##############################################################################
# You may want to redefine the AMS software directory (AMSDir) 
#   and/or
# your preferred XWindow editor (XEDITOR),
#
# By default, we try to take set AMSDir from the environemnt variable
# $AMSDir. If it is not defined, you will get an error message to help
# 
# In addition, you can change here below:
#    your preferred fonts (XFONTS_BUTTONS, XFONTS_TEXT),
#    your preferred height for the log window (Y_WIDTH_LOG),
#...
#
# Most of the features are evident by looking at the buttons. 
# Possible non-obvious features:
#
#   - You can recover the previous/next executed commands with the Up/Down keys
#     in the text-entry windows labelled as: 
#          "Edit AMS file:", "Search AMS term:", "Shell command:".
#
#   - When you try to edit the file [file], the program tries to edit, in 
#     the following order:
#           "$AMSDir/CC/[file]"
#           "$AMSDir/include/[file]"
#           "$AMSDir/F/[file]"
#           "$AMSDir/doc/[file]"
#           "$AMSDir/[file]"
#           "[file]"
#     It prints an error message otherwise.
#
#   - When you try to search for the term [term], the program searches in the 
#     following files:
#            "$AMSDir/*/*.C"
#            "$AMSDir/*/*.h"
#            "$AMSDir/*/*.F"
#
#   - To search for term [my_term] ignoring case, add "-i" at the end. For 
#     instance:
#                 "PathIntegral -i"
#
#   - The initial "current directory" is "$AMSDir", but you can change it via
#     a "cd [another_dir]" command in the "Shell command:" text-entry window.
#
#   - An older version had the possiblity to do a "cvs commit" too, but I 
#     have drop this option for safety. JUst do it manually. It is safer.
