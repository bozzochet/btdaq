/*! \example ana.root_static.doc
 *  The program below (ana.root_static.C) illustrates a way to analyze AMS Root 
 *  files with a C++ program statically linked. 
 *    - To compile it, link it and run it, you can use (both on Linux and on
 *      Alphas) the ams_run.sh script: 
 *                   - ams_run.sh ana.root_static.C
 *
 *    - Note that the program is prepared to be run in batch mode. Linking
 *      with additional object files would be required in order to visualize
 *      plots interactively.
 *
 *    - Also, it does not work with RFIO files for the time being.
 *
 *  \include ana.root_static.C
