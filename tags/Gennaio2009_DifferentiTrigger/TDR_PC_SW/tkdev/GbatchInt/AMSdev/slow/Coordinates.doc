Subroutine 

int Coordinates(double Coo_CAS[3], double Vel_CAS[3], double q[4], ulong time, double Coo_polar[3], double Vel_XYZ[3], double Shuttle_angles[3], double Sun_positin[3]);

is contained in file "Coordinates.c" with header file "Coordinates.h".
The input of the subroutine is: 
	the Shuttle coordinates, Coo_CAS (XYZ in M1950 reference system), 
	velocity, Vel_CAS (XYZ in M1950), 
	quaterions, q, as they are given in a CAS messages, 
	UNIX time.

The subroutine calculates:
	Polar Greenwich true-of-date coordinates of the Shuttle, 
		Coo_polar[3] = { R, teta, phi}
	Cartesian  Greenwich true-of-date velocity vector of the Shuttle,
	Shuttle Euler angles in LVLH system
		Shuttle_angles[3] = {Roll, Pitch, Yaw}
	 Polar Greenwich true-of-date position of the Sun,
		Sun_position[3] = { R, teta, phi }

All the angles are given in degrees, distances - in meters.
